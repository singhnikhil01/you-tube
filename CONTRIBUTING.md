## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

**Examples:**
```
feat: Add video playlist feature
fix: Resolve authentication redirect issue
docs: Update README with deployment instructions
refactor: Optimize video upload component
test: Add tests for comment functionality
```

**Commit Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### TypeScript Style Guide

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Define types/interfaces for all props and function parameters
- Avoid using `any` - use `unknown` if type is truly unknown
- Use `const` for variables that won't be reassigned
- Use descriptive variable and function names

**Example:**
```typescript
// Good
interface VideoCardProps {
  video: Video;
  onSelect: (videoId: string) => void;
}

const VideoCard: React.FC<VideoCardProps> = ({ video, onSelect }) => {
  // component logic
};

// Avoid
const VideoCard = (props: any) => {
  // component logic
};
```

### React/Next.js Guidelines

1. **Component Structure**
   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
   - Use Server Components by default, Client Components when needed

2. **File Organization**
   - One component per file
   - Co-locate related files (component, styles, tests)
   - Use index files to export from directories

3. **Naming Conventions**
   - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `VideoPlayer.tsx`)
   - Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
   - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `DEFAULT_LIMIT`)
   - Hooks: camelCase with "use" prefix (e.g., `useVideoPlayer`)

4. **State Management**
   - Use React hooks for local state
   - Use TanStack Query for server state
   - Prefer server-side data fetching when possible

5. **Styling**
   - Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
   - Follow mobile-first responsive design
   - Use Radix UI for accessible components
   - Keep custom CSS minimal

## Development Setup

### Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are set in `.env.local`:

```bash
# Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# Database
DATABASE_URL=

# Video Processing
MUX_TOKEN_ID=
MUX_TOKEN_SECRET=

# File Uploads
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=

# Redis
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Build the project
npm run build
```

### Database Changes

When modifying the database schema:

1. Update schema in `src/db/schema.ts`
2. Generate migration: `npm run db:generate`
3. Push to database: `npm run db:push`
4. Test your changes thoroughly

```

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Create Feature Module** in `src/modules/[feature-name]/`
   - `server/router.ts` - tRPC router
   - `server/service.ts` - Business logic
   - `ui/` - React components
   - `types.ts` - TypeScript types

2. **Add Database Tables** (if needed)
   - Update `src/db/schema.ts`
   - Generate and push migrations

3. **Create UI Components**
   - Add to `src/components/` or feature module
   - Use existing Radix UI components when possible

4. **Add Routes** in `src/app/`
   - Create route directories
   - Add `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` as needed

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README.md
   - Add inline code comments
   - Update API documentation if applicable
